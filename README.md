The aim of the system with which I am solving this domain, is to assist the game reserve working staff, 
to better manage their day to day operations, managing supplies for food courts, in house gift shop and medicine or vaccines for the in house clinic/Veterinary. 

## What will the system do?

- As the game reserve's tourist guides will be able to manage reservations for scheduled visits from international and local guests
- Will be able to store the game reserves equipment like the cars and suppliers for the food courts and gift stations
- Be able to generate monthly reports
- Access for the vet staff to keep track of animals brought in for vaccines
